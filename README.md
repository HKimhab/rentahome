This is a demo application that illustrates use of Windows Azure Mobile Services on four mobile platforms: Android, iOS, Windows Phone 8, and Windows 8.

Rent-a-Home is an application that helps users find apartments for rent and insert new apartments. It can also display apartments on a map. The application supports login (authentication) with Twitter, so apartments can be associated with the user that added them.
